They can discuss related topics and formulate and defend their own opinions in the group. and the Course Content: Health policy is becoming increasingly important within the European Union. According to Article 168 (7) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), responsibility for health policy and the organisation of healthcare and medical care for European citizens lies with the Member States; the EU healthcare system is therefore not harmonised. However, the EU does intervene in healthcare systems through, among other things, labour, competition and internal market law, and from 2013 through the ‘Directive on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare’. As a result, the EU mandate with regard to health is now quite far-reaching. Building on this theoretical background, the seminar will first provide an overview of EU competences regarding various aspects of healthcare. Individual aspects (reimbursement for rare diseases, inpatient care in border regions, the European Health Card, medicinal products and market access via the EMA, EU-wide examinations for healthcare professionals, EU-wide quality indicators, choice of healthcare insurer) will be explored in greater depth in the block seminar and on the basis of group work. \r\nDuring the seminar, participants will be expected to ask further questions, contribute to the lecturers‘ questions and express their own knowledge and opinions in the group (’active oral participation\"). Participants will continue to work on case studies by commenting on (fictitious) proposed changes to the Directive on the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare from the perspective of a given EU country. The aim is to present this opinion to the group and to work out a draft proposal in a plenary discussion on which all countries can agree. Students should be able to represent the interests of the given country as well as chair the plenary discussion for one of the case studies. Active oral participation (see above) is also expected."

Students who complete the course will be able to differentiate between the subject area of eHealth and related terms and categorise them scientifically. They will gain an insight into the industry with its technical and economic characteristics. They will also understand the necessity of the interaction of IT systems in the healthcare sector and the resulting opportunities. The current and planned future utilisation of IT systems can be recorded, understood and evaluated; this applies in particular to the areas of institutional IT in the healthcare sector (hospitals and doctors' surgeries), the planned telematics infrastructure and the use of mobile devices (mHealth). Examples and group work relating to the industrial and service sectors from the subject area are used to illustrate the content covered and apply it to practical, concrete issues. In addition, current issues relating to this topic are explored in greater depth in application, modelling and homework assignments. and the Course Content: The content of the lecture can be divided into four broad blocks. Firstly, the necessary terms in the field of eHealth and related topics are defined and put in relation to each other. In addition, the German healthcare system is characterised with its players, tasks and processes. The basics of information management in the (German) healthcare system are then discussed. These include electronic communication (e.g. eDoctor's letter, eReferral) and documentation (e.g. ePatient file) as well as legal requirements regarding, for example, electronic billing of services. Furthermore, the telematics infrastructure in general and IT systems of participating players in particular (e.g. hospitals) will be discussed here. Information management concepts are presented in order to understand system architectures and application landscapes of the organisations and networks involved. This includes software architecture and design, as well as modularisation and interfaces in particular. Furthermore, methods and techniques for controlling these architectures (e.g. EAM, BPM etc.) are also discussed. In addition, an understanding of the legal foundations of communication and data protection is to be created. Fundamental aspects of data protection, data security and data integrity are discussed in context. Finally, economic characteristics of the eHealth segment will be presented, focussing on healthcare markets, drivers and barriers to innovation and market forecasts. In particular, the mHealth segment with its relation to the consumer and trend topics (e.g. quantified self, wearables, etc.) will be addressed here. Presentations by cooperation partners will provide a practical reference and emphasise the importance of the topic. 1. eHealth basics: terms and definitions 2. information management in the healthcare sector 3. architecture concepts of information systems in the healthcare sector 4. application areas and business models of eHealth"

In particular, the question of the extent to which organisations and organisational units must be regarded as social entities structured by gender or as active ‘constructors’ of gender will be addressed. To this end, organisational structures and manifestations of the processes of ‘doing gender’ as well as internal organisational discourses on the legitimation or de-legitimation of gender differences and inequalities and their structural anchoring are empirically examined and analysed. The question is whether and how the respective organisational types and units are linked to the gender differences and inequalities produced outside the organisation, and how internal organisational processes in turn affect external gender orders. Based on current ways of addressing gender (such as gender mainstreaming and controlling, diversity, work-life balance), the scope for intervention and competencies for organisational development processes are discussed and the basics of competencies are taught."

Students learn about the scope, objectives, content, procedures and interrelationships of the main instruments under the Federal Nature Conservation Act and the Environmental Impact Assessment Act (landscape planning, protected areas, environmental impact assessment, strategic environmental assessment, impact regulation, FFH impact assessment and special species protection assessment) and can relate these to overall spatial planning and spatially effective sectoral planning. \r\nIn addition, this enables students to familiarise themselves with the structure and work steps of the specialist documents of the environmental assessment, to be able to prepare the relevant documents after further specialisation in the module ‘Practice of landscape planning and environmental assessment’, and to understand what distinguishes the role of environmental planners from that of expert assessors for individual environmental assets. Overall, students recognise how the expert reports in the environmental assessment are prepared in accordance with legal, technical and practical requirements and what they can achieve in practice. Students will also be able to categorise the instruments within the framework of nature conservation, environmental protection and sustainable development and identify the differences between them. They will also become aware of the conceptual vagueness of the basic terms of the discipline (nature, environment, landscape) and the associated need to address these in the respective planning process. and the Course Content: The lecture series ‘Environmental Issues of the 21st Century’ deals with key challenges from the perspective of the various disciplines of ecology and planning (and possibly landscape architecture), which they face in the 21st century and which graduates of the programme should contribute to overcoming. Examples include urbanisation, soil degradation, loss of biodiversity, climate change and a sustainable energy supply. In this way, introductory ‘topics’ are named and taught for which the instruments of landscape planning and environmental assessment are relevant. The course ‘Introduction to Landscape Planning and Environmental Assessment I’ aims to provide an overview of the instruments of landscape planning and environmental assessment in their entirety (protected areas, landscape planning, environmental impact assessment, strategic environmental assessment, impact regulation, FFH impact assessment, special species protection assessment), including their relationship to spatial and urban land-use planning and selected spatially relevant sectoral planning. The instruments and associated plans are explained on the basis of case studies, which provides an initial familiarisation with methods and procedures, which is deepened in the module ‘Practice of Landscape Planning and Environmental Assessment’. The course ‘Introduction to Landscape Planning and Environmental Assessment II’ firstly deepens knowledge of the instruments of environmental assessment and secondly introduces basic terms and concepts of the discipline. As part of the in-depth study of environmental assessment instruments, students will familiarise themselves with the core of the relevant professional field. The individual steps involved in preparing the integrating expert reports are presented and supported with exercises: - Environmental reports (of the strategic environmental assessment) include, among other things, the presentation of the environmental protection objectives applicable to the plan or programme, - EIA reports (of the environmental impact assessment) deal with, among other things, the expected environmental impacts of a project and planned measures to reduce the occurrence of adverse environmental impacts, en - Landscape conservation plans (for nature conservation intervention regulation) include, among other things, the planning of compensation and mitigation measures, en - Environmental impact assessment reports (of the environmental impact assessment) deal with, among other things, the planning of compensation and mitigation measures, en Specialist reports (for the FFH impact assessment and species protection assessment, saP) focus on determining whether projects or plans are likely to have a significant impact on an FFH area or violate the prohibitions in the case of protected species). In addition, there are examples of more recent fields of activity such as impact studies with regard to the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive. As part of the presentation of basic terms and concepts, the planning instruments mentioned are categorised in the fields of nature conservation and environmental protection as well as the concept of sustainable development. The terms nature, environment and landscape, which are fundamental to the discipline, are introduced and discussed. In addition, possible contributions of landscape planning to current environmental issues, e.g. climate change and its effects, can be presented."

Whether you are rich or poor, young or old, from the global north or the global south, climate and environmental change have different implications. Poorer people in industrialized countries experience a disproportionate cost of climate policy. Younger people have less responsibility for environmental degradation, but will bear it longer. People from the global south generally have a lower carbon footprint but are likely to suffer greater damage from climate change. The key question is how to reconcile the goals of reducing inequalities and protecting the environment. Are there “win-win” policies? If so, what are the obstacles to their implementation? The students learn how to use academic work on inequality to analyze environmental policies. and the Course Content: The seminar analyzes the challenges posed by economic and social inequalities in the context of global environmental change. It addresses several dimensions of inequality such as income, wealth, race, and gender. The link between inequality and the environment is examined along many perspectives, including economic theory, political science, climate science, and environmental justice. Among other topics, the seminar investigates if income inequality harms the environment and hinders the implementation of appropriate public policies. The overlap between distributive effects of environmental change and underlying inequalities is also discussed, together with the implications for the design of fair policies. Finally, debates on historical responsibility and inter-generational equity are introduced in the context of global climate action."

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to understand the many interrelated determinants that impact global health and disease on a scale ranging from the individual to society as a whole. These include politics, globalisation, sustainability, finance, equity, ethics, human rights, socio-cultural issues and climate change. Students will have gained insights into emerging diseases, the key determinants of global diseases and the interplay between biomedical, global and social processes that play a role in major global diseases. They will understand the different regulations, norms, actors, organisations and institutions involved at global, national, regional and local levels and be aware of the different health systems and contexts in which they operate. They will be able to discuss the challenges, opportunities and areas of tension associated with the increasing mobility of healthcare personnel and digitalisation. In addition, they will be able to critically assess (global) health policy measures, the increasing complexity of global health challenges and the performance of health systems at various levels. Various practical examples and group work help to deepen the acquired knowledge. The practice-orientated lectures and group work throughout the semester help students to illustrate and apply the course content. and the Course Content: Global health encompasses knowledge and perspectives from the fields of public health, medicine, epidemiology, health economics, behavioral sciences, environmental sciences, and anthropology, to name a few. This course aims to provide a foundational understanding of the ever-evolving field of global health, its disciplines, principles, actors, challenges and opportunities. The first part of the course starts with some basics and focuses on the global burden of disease (etiology) and the determinants of health - especially in relation to disadvantaged populations. In addition, students will become familiar with the scientific discussion on globalization processes and their impact on people's access to health care as well as the health problems resulting from climate change. We will also look at the global health agenda and the goals of global health care in different areas. The third part focuses on human rights, the impact on health (in)equality and equity and how social conditions can influence health and health inequalities. The fourth block deals with global health policy and the system as a whole, including considerations of 'good governance'. It will address issues of interplay between key actors and institutions involved in health at the global level (WHO, World Health Council, etc.), at the national level (public, private, NGO, etc.) and at the local level (civil society, patients, communities, etc.). It will show how this interplay determines and influences the functioning of health systems, their financing and issues of accountability. The course concludes with a consideration of the complex relationships between global health and technological innovation, the role of mobility of professionals and the impact on social, political and economic change."

The increase in complexity extends not only to market differentiation, products, processes and services, but also to the integration of different cultures and world views within the company. As a result, quality management in globally active companies is also confronted with new challenges as to how the quality promises made to customers can be kept worldwide. The lecture Global Quality Management explains which extended tasks global quality management will have to take on in the future, especially in the areas of product development, product manufacturing and product maintenance. It focuses in particular on the tension between centralised and decentralised responsibility for quality, and highlights possible solutions, taking into account the different cultural circumstances. This gives students a broader understanding of global quality management based on the challenges faced by international companies today. and the Course Content: After a brief introduction, the lecture presents the different global market strategies and the target figures that apply to every company, such as liquidity, turnover, return on investment, etc., and illustrates them using a globally active company in the plant engineering sector. The focus is on the tension between the domestic market and international market development, whereby the fundamental connection between a global understanding of quality and quality management as a prerequisite for global market success is discussed. The objectives and success factors for global quality management are presented on the basis of globally networked corporate structures using practical examples of product development, product manufacture and product maintenance. In this context, corporate management means global interface and intercultural change management, as the fulfillment of a uniform quality standard must be guaranteed despite all global heterogeneity.
