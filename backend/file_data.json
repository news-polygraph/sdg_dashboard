However, upon closer examination, this action can be seen as valuable in promoting energy efficiency and sustainability in the long term.\n\nSustainable cotton sourcing reduces the environmental impact of cotton production, which often relies on intensive energy use and chemical inputs. By prioritizing sustainable cotton, Adidas is supporting practices that require less energy and emit fewer greenhouse gases, thereby contributing to the goal of affordable and clean energy.\n\nReducing food waste in operations is another way that Adidas is promoting energy efficiency, as food waste contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and energy use throughout the supply chain. By reducing food waste, Adidas is helping to conserve energy and reduce the carbon footprint of its operations.\n\nPromoting agricultural education in supply chain communities is a valuable action in terms of ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. By empowering farmers and communities with the knowledge and skills needed to implement sustainable agriculture practices, Adidas is helping to create a more resilient and energy-efficient supply chain. Sustainable agriculture practices can lead to reduced energy use and emissions, improved soil health, and increased access to clean and affordable energy for rural communities.\n\nOverall, Adidas's commitment to sustainable practices and agricultural education in supply chain communities is a valuable action in promoting access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. While the impact may not be immediately visible, the long-term benefits of these actions can lead to significant energy savings, reduced emissions, and increased access to clean energy for marginalized communities."}, "3": {"score": 0.1, "factuality": 0.6, "tense": 0.2, "category": "action", "nl_explanation": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua.
