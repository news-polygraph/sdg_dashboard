This is because education is a crucial factor in achieving sustainable development, as it empowers people with the knowledge and skills they need to make informed decisions and take action for a sustainable future.\n\nAdidas' focus on SDG 4, which aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all, has indirect but important implications for SDG 7. By increasing global education initiatives, Adidas is contributing to building a more informed and empowered society that is better equipped to address the challenges of ensuring access to sustainable energy for all.\n\nMoreover, by promoting access to sports, Adidas is also contributing to the development of healthy and active communities, which can have positive impacts on the environment and the adoption of sustainable practices. For example, physically active individuals are more likely to adopt and maintain environmentally friendly behaviors, such as using public transportation or cycling instead of driving, reducing energy consumption, and participating in conservation efforts.\n\nIn summary, while Adidas' action may not appear to be directly related to ensuring access to sustainable energy, it is a valuable contribution to sustainable development more broadly and has indirect but important implications for SDG 7.
